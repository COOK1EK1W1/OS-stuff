## small project to demonstrate the algorithms in the F29OC class

### prerequisits
ensure you have python installed. Thats it basically

### disk seek algorithms
to run the disk seek algorithms, from the terminal run `python3 diskseek.py` which will run all three


### page eviction algorithms
to run the page eviction algorithms, from the terminal run `python3 pageEvict.py` which will run all three

parameters of both algorithms can be changed by opening either file, and modifiying the variables at the bottom of the file
